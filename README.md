# Noop Solana Program

This program does nothing. The point is the fact that Solscan counts transactions statistics even if the program does nothing. Useful to get stats about other instructions in the transaction.

Create `.env` file with:

```
PROGRAM_PRIVATE_KEY=
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

Before building and deploying the program, follow [Solana documentation](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/local-rust-hello-world).
